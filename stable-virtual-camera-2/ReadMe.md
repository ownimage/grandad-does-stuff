# Introduction

This directory relates to improving the stable virtual camera instructions I gave before.

There are two subdirectories.


| directory  | description                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01_upgrade | This will upgrade the previous stable virtual camera to remove the public url and run locally.  It is a very small fix and does not require a new download. |
| 02_debian  | This is a fresh install on a Python/Debian image to remove the Ubuntu dependency.  This will require a fresh download of the image models.                  |

Either route will get you to a working solution, choose your path, or explore both.
