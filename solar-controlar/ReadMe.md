# Introduction

I have solar panels and a GivEnergyInverter and battery.  

My tariff means that it is better to charge my battery during the day with excess PV energy (which I could sell at about 9p/unit)
rather than from the Grid overnight (where it costs me 15p/unit).

But I also want my battery to be 100% full at the start of the peak discharge price time where it can cost me 36p per unit to use
and I can sell for 26p.

So this project aims to get a solar forcast for the next day, and charge the battery overnight to the right level based on my typical usage.

## Prerequisites

You need to have a solar panels, a GivEnergy inverter and battery and a https://givenergy.cloud/ login.

We are going to get our solar prediction from https://solcast.com/
You need to create a login and define your solar installation there to get a forcast.

# Overview

## Development process
Develop in Docker, deploy on Raspberry Pi.

This limits the number of times I need to do clean builds and pull cards out of RPis etc.

## Doing the stuff
Every 5 mins we will apply the values from the config.json to limit the charging and discharging of the battery.

Once the discharge period is over in the evening we will:
1) fetch a new solar forcast
2) generate a config file

# Create the docker image for development
```sh
docker build -t solar-controlar:latest .
```

# Create the Woodpecker build agent
If you are going to follow the Woodpecker CI instructions then you will need this builder image
```shell
docker build -f Dockerfile-woodpecker-builder -t solar-controlar-build-agent:latest .
```

# Running the Container

## First time configuration
```shell
copy envfile_template envflie
```
**Edit the values of docker-compose.yml to reflect your environment.**  
DO NOT CHECK THIS INTO SOURCE CONTROL - unless you know what you are doing.

## Start the container and exec into it
```shell
docker login
```
```shell
docker compose up -d
```

```shell
docker exec -it -u user -w /app solarcontrolar bash
```
Note this is cmd not PowerShell

## Install crontabs
```shell
crontab crontab_file
```

## Run tests
```shell
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Getting a Forcast

```shell
python solar_forecast_generate.py
```

Samples

### usage_daily_averages.json
```json lines
{
    "Monday": 12.12,
    "Tuesday": 9.5,
    "Sunday": 9.99,
    "Holiday": 4.5
}
```

### usage_forcast.json
```json lines
{
    "2025-05-01": { "holiday": false, "kWh_adjustment": -1 },
    "2025-05-02": { "holiday": false, "kWh_adjustment": 1 }
}
```

### config.json
```json lines
{
  "morning_percentage": 20,
  "evening_percentage": 25
}
```
Meaning: 

morning_percentage between 02:00 and 05:00 charge the battery to a max of 20%.  This is the pre-fill so solar should get you to 100% by 16:00 the next day. During the winter this could be 100%.  

evening_percentage between 16:00 and 19:00 discharge the battery to a min of 25%. This is the evening reserve so that you dont need to buy from the grid later that evening.  STILL WORK IN PROGRESS.


### config-generator.py
This will be run on a daily basis at 20:00 ?  
It will fetch the solar forecast from solcast and update the solar_forecast.json
It will get the solar forecast for tomorrow
Ingest the usage estimate for 


## Other junk

We are going to get our solar prediction from toolkit.solcast.com.au
API documentation https://docs.solcast.com.au/


set SOLCAST_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
set SOLCAST_SITE_ID=<your-site-id>
```shell
docker run -it --rm -e SOLCAST_API_KEY=%SOLCAST_API_KEY% -e SOLCAST_SITE_ID=%SOLCAST_SITE_ID% -v "%cd%":/app -w /app solarcontrolar:latest bash
```

```
python main.py
```

What I need is a way to get forecasts and historic data.  I will compare the historic data with the GivEnergy
historic actuals to adjust the forcast to get a better result.

```shell
curl -X GET "https://api.givenergy.cloud/v1/inverter/FD2325G412/data?start=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&end=2024-01-31T23:59:59Z" \
